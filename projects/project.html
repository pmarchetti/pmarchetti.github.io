        <h4>About the Project</h4>
            <p>Weatherford operates in a very crowded space within the oil industry providing up-stream services. In order to attract new customers and maintain relationships with old ones, they attend a number of tradeshows each year. Unfortunately, the tradeshow space is equally as competitive and it is difficult to provide a unique experience. This is where our team came in. Weatherford approached our team at CMU to address their tradeshow situation, an avenue they recognize as having high potential for customer education and acquisition. We took this challenge through the product development cycle from identifying stakeholders and their desires to a final concept and business case. This project was completed as the capstone assignment for the Masters of Product Development program and Integrated Product Development course at CMU Spring 2014.</p>
            <h4>My Role</h4>
            <p>I served on the team as the lead designer among engineers and MBA students. My responsibilities included visual design of presented materials, conducting user research, and 3D concept development. Additionally, I served as team leader for the concept development phase where I led the team to design a concept that addressed our opportunity gap and user research findings.
                <br>Team Members: Kevin Gallagher, Shreshth Luthra, Brian Shyu, Crystal Wai, and Jack Zhuang </p>

        <h4>Tradeshow Challenge</h4>
            <p>Weatherford approached our team at CMU to address their tradeshow situation, an avenue they recognize as having high potential for customer education and acquisition. Our initial research looked at a competitive analysis of the upstream oil and gas industry, a competitive analysis of tradeshows, the pitfalls of tradeshows and information that visitors required for purchasing decisions. This information was used in later phases of development in order to make appropriate design decisions.</p>

        <h4>Research</h4>
            <p>We conducted user research to uncover key stakeholders, their concerns and how to provide the most positive experience for both Weatherford and their potential clients. Our initial research looked at a competitive analysis of the upstream oil and gas industry in both business and tradeshow environments.   We discovered our key stakeholders and conducted interviews to gain insights into their perceived problems with tradeshows. Though this process we found that cost, safety, efficiency, return on investment and case studies were the most important items of information needed for purchase decision making at a tradeshow.</p>

            <h4>Process</h4>
            <p>Following the initial user research, our group defined over 100 opportunities in this space. These opportunities were affinity diagrammed to uncover higher level themes and refine the opportunities to 10 based on those themes. Those 10 opportunities were ranked in a pugh chart to provide an objective view of each and then further refined to four opportunities. The final four were voted by on the team once more to determine where we could make the most impact given the varying skills of each team member. We settled on our product opportunity gap and began to ideate solutions. We developed over 100 solutions that were further refined and placed into a 2×2 chart ranking relationships. We validated our concepts through rounds of user research/testing until we could confidently inform our final concept design.</p>

        <h4>Product Opportunity Gap</h4>
            <p>There is an opportunity to reduce “dead time” and build relationships by providing relevant solutions in an interactive, immersive, and informative way.</p>

            <br><br>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>Our final concept provided a four-fold solution to the client’s challenge of innovating the tradeshow experience. The first component is the overall booth design which focuses on our innovative Wable at the center and pays specific attention to flow of visitors into and out of the booth. The placement of booth components allows for the center to not get too crowded and for those visitors more interested in browsing an easier opportunity to do so around the booth edges. The second component is our queuing system that allows for visitors to get in-line virtually to meet with representatives of the company that could best answer their questions regarding services and technology. This cuts down on “dead time” by ensuring that time is not wasted waiting for the wrong specialist. The third component, the central Wable (wall + table) provides two type of experiences for two stakeholders interested in assisted and unassisted curation of information. The final component is the UI of the Wable experience, which allows users to cycle through information relevant to them and package a digital set of documents for later reference. This solution provides value well beyond the current state tradeshow and with this solution, the client should be able to convert a higher percentage of visitors into customers at each show.</p>
