            <h4>About the Project</h4>
            <p>The Algae Production Incubator in Harrodsburg, Kentucky is a proposed multi-use research facility. Design in collaboration with the UK Center for Applied Energy Research (UK CAER), the facility will act as a hub for coal emissions research. Excess CO2 from the nearby coal-fired powerplant will be used to grow and harvest algae to contribute to cleaner coal emissions. A main building and five individual  facilities will meet the needs of the public- and private-sector opportunities for research. The complex was designed with geographical and environmental concerns in mind as well as to promote interaction between multiple stakeholders in the space. This project was completed as an undergraduate architecture studio project at the University of Kentucky, Spring 2012.</p><p>As an individual studio project, I was responsible for analyzing the site and surrounding area to effectively design for minimal environmental and geographic impact. Multiple design iterations through prototype modeling lead to two high-fidelty design models, renders, and additional 3D visualizations.</p>

         <h4>Analysis and Ideation</h4>
            <p>The project began with an analysis of the selected site. Desirable and undesireable sight lines were determinedwith the most desirable views being dominated by the location on the river. Additional consideration was given to the sun effects on the site and winds from the lake and Northwest.</p>

            <br><br>
            <p>Through iterative modeling, the form progressed from two simple buildings with a center coutryard to a multi-tiered structure that takes advantage of teh terrain and sight lines downriver.</p>
